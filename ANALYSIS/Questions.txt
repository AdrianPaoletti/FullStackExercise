●	What do you think is wrong with the code, if anything?
    I think that the second condition after the exec method, the one releated to the shop invitations,
    will lead to errors. It will push all invitations inside the invitations property even though they already exists, 
    with the exception of the one that has the 0 index.

●	Can you see any potential problems that could lead to exceptions
    Yes, if the invitation conditon resolves to true then the invitation is pushed. If after that, the user's 
    conditon resolves to false then the user won't be pushed. That creates the possibility that a user 
    could have more than one invitation or to have invitations in the air. A posible solution will be to 
    specify both conditions in an if statement. But it would create another exception, if the user exists but had 
    have lost the invitation.
